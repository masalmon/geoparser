Description: A wrapper for the Geoparser.io API version 0.4.0 (see <https://geoparser.io/>), which is a web service
    that identifies places mentioned in text, disambiguates those places, and
    returns detailed data about the places found in the text. Basic, limited
    API access is free with paid plans to accommodate larger workloads.
